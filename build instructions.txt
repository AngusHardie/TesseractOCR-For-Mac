==================


Xcode4 builds the whole system using its built in dependency system

Note that this build has been modified in various places to remove Tesseract UI specific things 
that aren't supported yet. These generally consist of blocks of code which are defined out using
GRAPHICS_DISABLED.


Ideally of course this build will eventually get a cocoa
layer to support ScrollView and actually be able to display the notices properly. 
If I get more time I may be able to get around to this, but if you can get this done first 
please do, it will be a noticable improvement.
