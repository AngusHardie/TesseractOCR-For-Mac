<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<simpara>Tesseract needs to know the set of possible characters it can output.
To generate the unicharset data file, use the unicharset_extractor
program on the same training pages bounding box files as used for
clustering:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">unicharset_extractor fontfile_1.box fontfile_2.box ...</literallayout>
<simpara>Tesseract needs to have access to character properties isalpha,
isdigit, isupper, islower, ispunctuation. This data must be encoded
in the unicharset data file. Each line of this file corresponds to
one character. The character in UTF-8 is followed by a hexadecimal
number representing a binary mask that encodes the properties. Each
bit corresponds to a property. If the bit is set to 1, it means that
the property is true. The bit ordering is (from least significant bit
to most significant bit): isalpha, islower, isupper, isdigit,
ispunctuation.
(See unicharset(5))</simpara>
<simpara>If your system supports the wctype functions, these values will be set
automatically by unicharset_extractor and there is no need to edit the
unicharset file. On some older systems (eg Windows 95), the unicharset
file must be edited by hand to add these property description codes.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">NOTE</emphasis> The unicharset file must be regenerated whenever inttemp, normproto
and pffmtable are generated (i.e. they must all be recreated when the box
file is changed) as they have to be in sync. This is made easier than in
previous versions by running unicharset_extractor before mftraining and
cntraining, and giving the unicharset to mftraining.</simpara>
